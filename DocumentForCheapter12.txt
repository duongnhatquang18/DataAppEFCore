1. ef core does not include where statement in sql
re-produce:
	var products = _context.Products;

	if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(category))
	{
		products.Where(p => p.Category == category);
	}
	products.tolist()
	
	sql statement: select * from products .
	
issue:
	sql statement doesn't include the where statement .
solution:
	- products should be assigned to itself after using where.
	- i.e

		if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(category))
		{
			procucts = products.Where(p => p.Category == category);
		}
2. Delete 
	
	As default we know that ef core support delete by passing object. But the input is just only id . 
	i.e 
		public void DeleteProduct(long id) {
			Product p = context.Products.Find(id);
			context.Products.Remove(p);
			context.SaveChanges();
		}
	Question ? How can delete the object without reading the database ? 
	Solution: Create a dummy object with Id = id.
		public void DeleteProduct(long id) 
		{
			Product p = new Product{Id = id};
			context.Products.Remove(p);
			context.SaveChanges();
		}
